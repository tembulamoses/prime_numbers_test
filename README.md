# prime_numbers_test
# This is a simple application that generates prime numbers from 2 to a specified number in the function the function was tested for functionality and all the specified tests passed. 

# The tests include only integers greator than 1 accepted, output is list of prime numbers 

# An assymptotic analysis was done and the function shows a linear performance with increasing input size

# The asymptotic analysis shows that the performance of the function reduces linearly with increasing input i.e the range over which to find the prime numbers
